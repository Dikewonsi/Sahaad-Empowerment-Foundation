                                First of all, to clear any doubts, there is no link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This has been a great controversy in autism spectrum disorder. In spite of the wide-ranging research, no reliable study has shown any link between autism spectrum disorder and any vaccines.
                                <br><br>
                                Evading vaccines for kids can place a child and probably others around in danger of catching and spreading serious diseases, including whooping cough (pertussis), measles, or epidemic parotitis.
                                Secondly, autism spectrum disorder has no single known cause.
                                <br><br>With the complex nature of the disorder, then the fact that signs and severity vary, there are many causes. But in summary, genetics and environment play major roles in autism diagnosis.
                                Different genes are involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. <br><br> For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still, other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. <br><br> Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously.
                                Researchers are currently trying to discover whether issues such as complications during pregnancy, air pollutants, virus-related infections, or medications play any role in causing autism spectrum disorder.
                                Considering the risk factors involved currently, the number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is rising. It’s not clear whether this is due to better detection and reporting or a real increase in the number of cases, or both.
                                <br><br>
                                Autism spectrum disorder isn’t limited to a particular race or creed, but certain factors increase a child’s risk. For instance, boys are more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls. Family history and other disorders like children with certain medical conditions have a higher-than-normal risk of autism spectrum disorder or autism-like symptoms. Instances include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use. (Mayo-Clinic, 2018)
                                Other factors to note include having extremely preterm babies. There are children born before a 26-week gestation period.
                                Older Parents are at risk of having autistic children.</p>
