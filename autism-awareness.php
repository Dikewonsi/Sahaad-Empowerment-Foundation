                            <p class="mb-20 mt-20">Autism acceptance requires empathy and an understanding that ASD is different for everyone. Certain therapies and approaches can work for some people but not others.
                                Understanding autism and autistic people starts with awareness, but it doesn’t end there. It’s advisable to know the difference between ASD and ADHD. Autism and ADHD are sometimes confused with one another. Children with an ADHD diagnosis consistently have issues with fidgeting, concentrating, and maintaining eye contact with others. These symptoms are also seen in some autistic people.
                                Despite some similarities, ADHD is not considered a spectrum disorder. One major difference between the two is that people with ADHD do not tend to lack socio-communicative skills.
                                If you think your child may be hyperactive, talk with their doctor about possible ADHD testing. Getting a clear diagnosis is essential to ensure that your child is receiving the right support. It’s also possible for a person to have both autism and ADHD..</p>
                            <p>In all these, its best to note that;</p>
                            <p>Autism is not an illness</p>
                            <p>Being autistic does not mean you have an illness or disease. It means your brain works differently from other people.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                            <p>
                                It’s something you’re born with or first appears when you’re very young.</p>

                            <p>Once a child is diagnosed as autistic, he or she remains autistic their whole life.</p>
                            <p>Autism is not a medical condition with treatments or a “cure”. But some people need support to help them with certain things.</p>
